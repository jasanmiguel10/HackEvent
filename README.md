# BullyFree

BullyFree is a solution for bullying.
  - We detect cyberbullying by using a convolutional neural network. 
  - We visualize in a heatmap where is bullying popular in the United States.
  - We plan to predict where will bullying happen next.

# Our vision
We belive in a world were technology and social media aren't used for cyberbullying but instead for learning. We seek to transform  social media into a safe place without hate speech.
